CkFu
====

Where does the name ck_fu come from? It's a play on attachment_fu and I think curse words are funny.

This will put a bar across the top of your screen (except in production) that shows the environment, databases, revision, etc. Why do we
need something like this? because the development and staging sites often look identical to the production site. This makes it easy to tell
the difference between the sites at a glance.

Example
=======

* Run rake ck_fu:copy_styles
* Add ck_fu.css to your list of stylesheets
* Add the following directly below your <body> tag
<%= ck_fu %>

More Advanced Usage
===================

<%= ck_fu(:production => {:show_if => current_user.admin?, :show => true}) %>
